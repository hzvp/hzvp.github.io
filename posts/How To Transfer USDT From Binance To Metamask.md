## Preparing Your Wallets for USDT Transfer  

Before initiating the transfer, ensure both your **Binance account** and **MetaMask wallet** are properly configured.

MetaMask supports multiple blockchain networks, but USDT operates on two primary protocols:  
- **TRC20** (TRON network)  
- **ERC20** (Ethereum network)

3. Input the correct network parameters (e.g., RPC URL, chain ID).  

### Step 2: Verify Binance Withdrawal Options  
Log into your Binance account and navigate to **Wallet > Withdraw**. Choose **USDT** as the cryptocurrency and confirm the withdrawal network matches the one selected in MetaMask (TRC20 or ERC20).

## Common Issues and Solutions

Transferring USDT via the wrong network (e.g., sending ERC20 on TRC20) can result in lost funds. Always double-check network settings on both platforms.  

### Issue 2: High Transaction Fees  
ERC20 transfers often incur higher gas fees than TRC20. Consider network congestion when choosing protocols.  

### Issue 3: Delayed Transactions  
If the transfer doesnâ€™t appear in MetaMask after 1 hour:  
- Verify the transaction hash on a blockchain explorer.  
- Contact Binance support with the withdrawal ID.
