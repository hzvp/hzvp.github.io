# Bitcoin Pizza Day: The 10,000 BTC Spent on 2 Pizzas Now Worth $268 Million  

## The Origins of Bitcoin Pizza Day  
Every year on May 22nd, the crypto community celebrates **Bitcoin Pizza Day**â€”a milestone marking the first real-world transaction using Bitcoin (BTC). This historic event occurred on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz famously traded **10,000 BTC** for two Papa Johnâ€™s pizzas in Florida. At the time, the transaction was valued at just $41, but today, those 10,000 BTC are worth approximately **$268 million USD** (or Â¥37 billion JPY).  

This seemingly trivial trade laid the groundwork for Bitcoinâ€™s evolution from a niche digital experiment to a global financial asset. The event is now commemorated annually, blending humor and reverence for cryptoâ€™s humble beginnings.

## How the Crypto Community Celebrates  
The tradition of celebrating Bitcoin Pizza Day has grown into a global phenomenon. In 2023, communities worldwide hosted pizza parties, shared memes, and reflected on Bitcoinâ€™s journey. For example:  
- **Bali, Indonesia**: A group of crypto enthusiasts posted photos of their pizza feast on social media.  
- **Naples, Italy**: Crypto exchange Binance hosted a pizza event to honor the occasion.  
- **OKX Offices**: Employees celebrated with pizza-themed lunches, highlighting the platformâ€™s commitment to fostering crypto culture.

## The Legacy of Laszlo Hanyecz and Jeremy Sturdivant  
While Hanyecz is celebrated as the man who "bought" Bitcoinâ€™s first pizza, the story wouldnâ€™t be complete without Jeremy Sturdivant, the intermediary who facilitated the transaction. Sturdivant, who initially purchased the pizzas and received the 10,000 BTC, has been dubbed the "unsung hero" of this tale by some in the community. Speculation about his actions persists:  
- Did he sell his BTC for a fraction of its potential value?  
- Or did he lose access to his private keys, leaving the coins dormant forever?  

Reddit forums buzz with theories about Sturdivantâ€™s fate, though he has remained largely out of the spotlight.  

## Could Bitcoinâ€™s First Transaction Have Been an NFT?  
Interestingly, the pizza trade isnâ€™t universally recognized as Bitcoinâ€™s first real-world purchase. In May 2023, crypto historians reignited debates by citing a pre-2010 transaction where a JPEG image was sold for 500 BTC. This "primordial NFT" predates both the pizza deal and the modern NFT craze. Even more intriguing: Bitcoinâ€™s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, reportedly participated in this early transaction, hinting at the communityâ€™s experimental roots.  

## The Value of 10,000 BTC Over Time  
To grasp the magnitude of Bitcoinâ€™s growth, consider its trajectory:  

| Year | Bitcoin Price (USD) | Value of 10,000 BTC |  
|------|---------------------|---------------------|  
| 2010 | <$0.01              | <$41                |  
| 2013 | $1,000              | $10 million         |  
| 2017 | $20,000             | $200 million        |  
| 2023 | $26,800             | $268 million        |  

This exponential growth underscores Bitcoinâ€™s role as a store of value and its disruptive potential.
