## 🔄 Stuck Exchange Transactions: A Step-by-Step Breakdown  

Changelly transactions progress through four stages. Understanding these helps diagnose delays:  

| **Stage**             | **Possible Causes**                                                                 | **Solutions**                                                                 |  
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Waiting for Payment    | Overloaded blockchain, incorrect memo/destination tag, wrong network                | Verify transaction details; contact support if issues persist                 |  
| Confirming             | Insufficient blockchain confirmations                                               | Check network status; wait for required confirmations                         |

## 📌 Wallet Address Validation  

### ❓ Why Is My Wallet Address Invalid?  
Changelly’s non-reusable addresses require strict validation:  

- **Currency Mismatch**: Sending ETH to a BTC address will fail.  
- **Network Protocol Errors**: USDT Omni (1xxx) vs. USDT ERC-20 (0x...) require network-specific addresses.  
- **Typos/Extra Spaces**: Double-check address characters and spacing.  

> **Solution**: Use Changelly’s protocol selector (e.g., USDT20 for ERC-20) to ensure compatibility.

## 💸 USDT vs. USDT20: Avoiding Costly Mistakes  

| **Token Type**        | **Network Protocol** | **Address Format** | **Common Use Cases**                          |  
|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|  
| USDT (Omni)           | Omni Layer           | 1xxx               | Legacy BTC-based transactions                 |  
| USDT20 (ERC-20)       | Ethereum             | 0x...              | Smart contracts, DeFi applications            |  
| USDTRX (TRC-20)       | Tron                 | Txxx               | Low-fee cross-border payments                 |  

> **Critical Tip**: Always match the network protocol in Changelly’s dropdown menu to your wallet’s capabilities.

## 🧩 Advanced Troubleshooting  

### ❓ "Not Yet Redeemed" Status Explained  
For DASH, DOGE, and Bitcoin-based assets, this status indicates successful receipt but no subsequent spending. No action required unless funds remain unprocessed beyond 24 hours.  

### ❓ Lost 2FA Device?  
Disable two-factor authentication by contacting support@changelly.com with your account verification details.  

### ❓ Ethereum/Tron Contract Address Errors  
Ensure recipient addresses are **non-contract** type. Contract addresses may block fund delivery. Consult your wallet’s documentation for guidance.
