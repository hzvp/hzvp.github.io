## How Does Dogecoin Work?  

Dogecoin operates on blockchain technology, using the Scrypt algorithm inherited from Litecoin. Miners validate transactions by solving cryptographic puzzles, earning 10,000 DOGE per block. Unlike Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins, DOGE has no maximum supply, resulting in inflationary dynamics.  

### Unique Aspects of Dogecoin  
- **Low Transaction Fees**: Ideal for microtransactions.  
- **Community-Driven**: A passionate user base that funds charitable projects.  
- **Cultural Impact**: Popularized by social media trends and celebrity endorsements, notably from Elon Musk.
