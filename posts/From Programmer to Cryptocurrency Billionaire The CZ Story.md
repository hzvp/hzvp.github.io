# From Programmer to Cryptocurrency Billionaire: The CZ Story

## The Rise of Bitcoin and the New Wealth Era  
The cryptocurrency world moves at an unprecedented pace. As the saying goes, "A day in crypto feels like a decade in real life." Nowhere is this more evident than in the rise of Bitcoin, which surged from approximately $5,000 in March 2020 to nearly $60,000 by March 2021â€”a staggering 1,100% increase in just 12 months.
