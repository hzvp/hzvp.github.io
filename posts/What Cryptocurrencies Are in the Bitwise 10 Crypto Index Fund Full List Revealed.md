## Core Holdings of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund

The fundâ€™s portfolio is dynamic, but its current top holdings include:

### 1. **Bitcoin (BTC)**
As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin dominates the market with a ~50% share. Its decentralized nature, capped supply of 21 million coins, and growing institutional adoption make it a cornerstone asset. Bitcoinâ€™s role as a "digital gold" positions it as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty.

### 2. **Ethereum (ETH)**
Ethereumâ€™s smart contract capabilities underpin the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFT ecosystems. The 2022 Ethereum Merge transitioned it to a proof-of-stake model, reducing energy consumption by 99.95%. This upgrade has strengthened ETHâ€™s appeal as both a transactional asset and a staking yield generator.

### 3. **Binance Coin (BNB)**
Issued by the worldâ€™s largest cryptocurrency exchange, BNB powers the Binance Smart Chain, enabling fast, low-cost transactions. Beyond its utility in trading fee discounts, BNB supports Binanceâ€™s ecosystem of products, including DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces.

### 4. **Cardano (ADA)**
Cardano differentiates itself through rigorous academic research and a layered architecture. Its proof-of-stake protocol, Ouroboros, aims to enhance scalability and security. ADAâ€™s focus on sustainability and interoperability positions it as a long-term player in the blockchain space.

### 5. **Solana (SOL)**
Solanaâ€™s high throughput (50,000+ transactions per second) and sub-$0.01 fees make it a favorite for decentralized applications (dApps). Its hybrid consensus mechanism combines proof-of-stake and proof-of-history, offering speed without sacrificing decentralization.

### 6. **XRP (XRP)**
Developed by Ripple, XRP facilitates cross-border payments for financial institutions. Despite ongoing legal battles with the SEC, its partnerships with banks and payment processors underscore its utility in remittances.

### 7. **Polkadot (DOT)**
Polkadot enables interoperability between blockchains, allowing data and assets to flow seamlessly across networks. Its parachain auction system fosters innovation, making it a key player in the multi-chain future.

### 8. **Chainlink (LINK)**
Chainlink provides decentralized oracle services, bridging smart contracts with real-world data. Its integration with major DeFi platforms like Aave and Synthetix ensures consistent demand for LINK tokens.

### 9. **Litecoin (LTC)**
Often dubbed "digital silver," Litecoin offers faster transaction times (2.5-minute blocks) compared to Bitcoinâ€™s 10-minute intervals. While its market relevance has waned slightly, LTC remains a trusted asset for peer-to-peer transactions.

### 10. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**
A hard fork of Bitcoin, BCH prioritizes scalability by increasing block sizes to 32MB. This allows for cheaper transactions, though its adoption lags behind other Layer 1 blockchains.
